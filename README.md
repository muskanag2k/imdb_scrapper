# README

Your program should accept N as an input parameter and do the following:  
Fetch the list of top N movies from the IMDb website and build an DB knowledge base comprising of  
the names of the movies  
the names of the cast of each movie  
This should be built at runtime and stored in a suitable data structure of your choice.  
Provide a query interface (command line would do) to query this knowledge base by actor’s name. For a given actor and a number M (< N), it should return the top M movies they have acted in.  



commands -
